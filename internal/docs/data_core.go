		Aliases:  []string{"keywords"},
		Title:    "reserved words and the constructs they introduce",
		Synopsis: `luascript doc syntax.match`,
		Detail: `luascript is Lua 5.4 syntax plus Luau-style gradual types and a handful
of extra statements. Several extensions are desugared in the parser and
have no dedicated bytecode: compound assignment, backtick string
interpolation, and match.

type, struct, interface and continue are contextual keywords — they still work as
ordinary identifiers where no such statement can start. match, enum,
defer, try, catch and throw are hard keywords.`,
		SeeAlso: []string{"_G"},
		Entries: []Entry{
			{Name: "local", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "local x [, y] = expr [, expr]",
				Summary: "Declares block-scoped variables. Attributes are supported: `local x <const> = 1` and `local h <close> = f()`."},
			{Name: "destructuring", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "local { a, b } = t  |  local [ first, second ] = t",
				Summary: "Binds several locals from one table in a single local statement.",
				Detail: `The braced form reads named fields; the bracketed form reads positions
1..n. A field may be renamed ({ host = h } binds t.host to h), typed
({ port: number }), given a fallback for nil ({ timeout or 30 }), and the
last entry may be a rest binding ({ a, ...others }) that collects
everything not named before it into a fresh table. The checker resolves
each name against the source table's type, so a field the type does not
declare is a compile error. See examples/60_destructuring.lsc.`},
			{Name: "spread", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "{ ...a, ...b, extra }",
				Summary: "Merges other tables into a table constructor. Array entries are appended in order and named keys are copied, with later entries winning. See examples/60_destructuring.lsc."},
			{Name: "interface", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "interface Name { field: T }",
				Summary: "Declares a named structural type. Equivalent to a type alias whose target is a table, kept as its own form so the formatter round-trips it, and intended for use as a generic constraint. A contextual keyword. See examples/61_generic_constraints.lsc."},
			{Name: "function", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "function f(a: T, b: T = default): R ... end",
				Summary: "Declares a function. Parameters may carry type annotations and default values; a defaulted parameter falls back only on nil, not on false."},
			{Name: "if", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "if c then ... elseif c2 then ... else ... end",
				Summary: "Conditional statement. There is also an if *expression*: `local v = if c then a else b` — no end, arms are single expressions, else is mandatory."},
			{Name: "for", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "for i = a, b [, step] do ... end  |  for k, v in pairs(t) do ... end",
				Summary: "Numeric and generic loops. Both forms close upvalues on every exit path, including break and continue."},
			{Name: "while", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "while cond do ... end",
				Summary: "Loops while cond is truthy."},
			{Name: "repeat", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "repeat ... until cond",
				Summary: "Loops until cond is truthy; the body always runs once. A continue inside jumps to the until condition, so the condition may not read a local declared after that continue."},
			{Name: "break", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "break",
				Summary: "Exits the innermost enclosing loop. Does not cross a function boundary."},
			{Name: "continue", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "continue",
				Summary: "Skips to the next iteration of the innermost loop. A contextual keyword: `continue = 1` still parses as an identifier."},
			{Name: "goto", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "goto label  ::label::",
				Summary: "Jumps to a label in the same function. Jumping across a try boundary is a compile error."},
			{Name: "return", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "return [expr, ...]",
				Summary: "Returns from the enclosing function. Must be the last statement in its block."},
			{Name: "defer", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "defer ... end",
				Summary: "Registers a block to run when the enclosing function returns, however it returns — including through an error. See examples/32_defer.lsc."},
			{Name: "try", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "try <body> catch [e] do <handler> end",
				Summary: "Runs body with a protected region installed in the current frame.",
				Detail: `Because the region lives in the enclosing frame rather than in a
closure, return, break and continue inside a try act on the enclosing
function or loop, and the body's locals are ordinary frame slots. The
error binding is optional; the do is not. See examples/55_try_catch.lsc.`},
			{Name: "throw", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "throw expr",
				Summary: "Raises expr as an error. A dedicated opcode, not a call to error, so shadowing error cannot re-point it."},
			{Name: "match", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "match subject do pattern -> expr ... end",
				Summary: "Pattern-matching statement. A first-class node: the bytecode generator lowers it to one test-and-branch per arm.",
				Detail: `Destructuring patterns are gated on names declared in the chunk:
Circle(r) destructures only when Circle is a payload-carrying enum
variant, and Point{ x = a } only when Point is a struct. Any other
call-shaped pattern is compared by value.

When the subject's type has a finite domain — a tagged enum, a singleton
union, an enum, or boolean — the arms are checked for exhaustiveness and
a missing case is a compile error. Guarded arms do not count as coverage,
since a guard can fail. An untyped subject is never checked, so plain Lua
is unaffected. See examples/44_match.lsc.`},
			{Name: "enum", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "enum Name V1, V2 end",
				Summary: "Declares an enum. Lowered to a frozen table of auto-incrementing integers; the typechecker types the alias as the exact literal union of those values (RED, GREEN => 1 | 2), so out-of-range numbers are rejected and match can check exhaustiveness. Payload-carrying (tagged) variants are supported — see examples/43_tagged_enums.lsc."},
			{Name: "struct", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "struct Name x: number, y: number end",
				Summary: "Declares a struct type and its constructor. A contextual keyword. See examples/42_structs.lsc."},
			{Name: "type", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "type Name = T  |  type Box<T> = { value: T }",
				Summary: "Declares a type alias, optionally generic. A contextual keyword. Aliases may be primitives, literals, unions, intersections, optionals, function types or structural tables."},
			{Name: "generic constraints", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "function f<T: Named>(x: T): T ... end",
				Summary: "Bounds a type parameter by another type.",
				Detail: `A constrained parameter is checked at every use: an explicit type
argument (Box<number>) and an inferred one (from the argument types at a
call) must both be assignable to the bound. Inside the body the parameter
is still gradual, but it carries its bound, so field access resolves
through it. Constraints are accepted on functions, type aliases and
structs. See examples/61_generic_constraints.lsc.`},
			{Name: "intersection types", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "type Both = Named & Aged",
				Summary: "A value satisfying every member.",
				Detail: `Only table shapes (and any) can be intersected; the checker merges their
fields into one shape, with later members winning on a clash. The &
operator binds tighter than |, so A & B | C is (A & B) | C.`},
			{Name: "literal types", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: `type Mode = "read" | "write" | "append"`,
				Summary: "A string, number or boolean literal is a type of its own, inhabited by that one value.",
				Detail: `A singleton is assignable to its base primitive but not the reverse, so
a slot annotated "read" | "write" rejects every other string. Comparing
against one narrows a union (if m == "read" then ...), and a union of
singletons is what gives match a domain to check exhaustively.

Inference widens: local m = "read" is a string, so it stays assignable.
Write the annotation (local m: Mode = "read") or assert ("read" :: Mode)
to keep the singleton. See examples/05_types.lsc.`},
			{Name: "and", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "a and b",
				Summary: "Short-circuit conjunction: returns a when a is falsy, otherwise b. The typechecker narrows across it."},
			{Name: "or", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "a or b",
				Summary: "Short-circuit disjunction: returns a when a is truthy, otherwise b. `x or default` drops nil from the result type."},
			{Name: "not", Kind: EntryKeyword, Signature: "not a",
				Summary: "Logical negation; yields a boolean. Propagates type narrowing to the negated branch."},
			{Name: "nil", Kind: EntryConstant, Signature: "nil",
				Summary: "The absent value. Only nil and false are falsy."},
			{Name: "true", Kind: EntryConstant, Signature: "true",
				Summary: "The true boolean."},
			{Name: "false", Kind: EntryConstant, Signature: "false",
				Summary: "The false boolean — one of the two falsy values, along with nil."},
